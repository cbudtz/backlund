	modernisation within wastewater handling. New technologies as well as new

&nbsp;
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The 
	project was carried out during a 4-year period&nbsp;(1998-2002)&nbsp;with financial 
	support from the EU FAIR Programme&nbsp;in the shape of&nbsp;field trials with 
	recycling of pre-treated wastewater and diverted human urine mixed with 
	water within plantations of willow species specifically selected for biomass 
	production.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">
	Experimental sites were established in Sweden (Roma), France (Orchies), 
	Northern Ireland (Culmore) and Greece (Larissa).&nbsp;BACKLUND represented 
	Denmark in the project and Arne Backlund was project manager for the urine 
	trials on Gotland, Sweden.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The 
	experimental sites were supplied with primary effluent from municipal 
	treatment plants (Culmore and Larissa), stored industrial effluent from a 
	chicory processing plant (Orchies), biologically treated and stored 
	municipal wastewater (Roma) and human urine mixture from diverting low-flush 
	toilets mixed with water (Roma). Application rates of the wastewaters or the 
	urine mixture were equivalent to the calculated evapo­transpiration rate at 
	each site. Wastewaters were also applied up to three times this value to 
	evaluate any possible negative effects.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">
	Estimations and evaluations were carried out mainly concerning: biomass 
	growth, potential pest and diseases of the plantations, plant water 
	requirements, fertilization effects of the wastewater, plant uptake of 
	nutrients and heavy metals from applied wastewater, possible soil or 
	groundwater impact, sanitary aspects, and potentials for removal in the 
	soil-plant filter of nutrients and biodegradable organic material from 
	applied wastewater.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The 
	results clearly indicated that biomass production in young willow 
	plantations could be enhanced substantially after recycling of wastewater 
	resources. The impact on soil and ground­water of nutrients (nitrogen and 
	phosphorus) and heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead and cadmium) was limited, 
	even when the application of water and nutrients exceeded the plant 
	requirements.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">
	Also, the soil-plant system seemed to function as a natural treatment filter 
	for pre-treated (primary settled) wastewater, with a treatment rate fully 
	comparable to a tertiary effluent quality with regard to biodegrad­able 
	organic material and eutrophying nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB">Introductory analyses of the costs of a wastewater irrigated willow 
	plantation for bio-fuel production indicate that the benefits of the 
	wastewater treatment per se appear to be greater than the benefits from the 
	increased production of wood chips. The risks of con­tamination via faecal 
	microorganisms of animals and humans seem possible to reduce or eliminate if 
	proper precautions are taken.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The 
	gathered opinion from the members of the multidisciplinary project team is 
	that the concept of recycling wastewater or fractions of wastewater within 
	willow plantations for com­bined energy production and wastewater treatment 
	would be worth developing on a wider scale. Experiences from few full-scale 
	facilities in Sweden are well in accordance with the findings outlined in 
	this project.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The 
	fact that wastewater could be treated at reasonable costs might encourage 
	the municipal sector as well as the energy and agricultural industry in 
	Europe to further expand the concept with increased willow plantation areas 
	as a con­sequence. This would increase the opportunities for an over all 
	better environment for generations to come.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The
